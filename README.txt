Water Lily
============

Water Lily is a minimal two column responsive theme designed to showcase artwork and photography using Masonry. It's simple for new users to set up and looks best with large images and a minimal sidebar. Once installed and activated you can customize the site by changing the background colour and upload your logo. Developers can easily extend the code in a child theme. French translation is provided. 

Thank's once again to everyone at Automattic for creating _s and the Monster Widget. 
Both are useful for making theme development a pleasure. 

Google Web Fonts used: Oswald, Noto Sans.

This theme requires that you use WordPress version 3.9 or higher. 
Masonry is not compatible with older version of WordPress. 

* Installation and set up *
---------------------------
Download the theme at WordPress.org like you would any other theme, install it and activate it. 
Once installed, create your blog posts and add featured images if you wish. 
The blog section will appear on the home page as the default. 
If your blog posts have featured images, you will see an image and the title of your posts. These are clickable and lead to the posts. 
If you do not have featured images, the title of your posts will appear followed by the excerpt below.
Please note that only blog posts appear on the home page masonry display.

Your pages will automatically appear in the sidebar navigation, unlesss you create a custom menu.
